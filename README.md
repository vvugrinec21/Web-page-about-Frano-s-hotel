Frano's Hotel Repository is a dynamic platform that uses Node.js for server-side logic. Our REST API services are implemented using Node.js to enable fast and reliable retrieval of data about our fictional hotel.

Additionally, for more interactive features on our website, we employ JavaScript. This allows us to create dynamic elements on the page such as interactive forms, animations, and other user interfaces that enhance the user experience.

Hotel data, stored in JSON, CSV, and TXT formats, is regularly updated to ensure the accuracy and relevance of the information we provide to our visitors. These data are then used on the server to generate dynamic content displayed on the Frano's Hotel Repository website. This dynamic approach ensures that users always have the latest information about the hotel and can utilize various features and services we offer.
